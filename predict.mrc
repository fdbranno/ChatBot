    MSG $chan The !predict game is simple.  It costs no points to enter.  You make a prediction of what percentage that the predict hack will end at.  If your guess is closest to the final percentage of the hack, you will win points!  If you get the percentage exactly correct (except for 100%), then you will win twice as many points!  Points are split if there is a tie.  Predict using !predict [percentage]

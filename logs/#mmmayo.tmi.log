[21:41] <starcaster603> How are y'all? Finally was able to stop by ^.^
[21:41] <mintjoker505803> I'm hungover but can't complain too much
[21:42] <facetiousz> same tbh
[21:42] <facetiousz> time for fallout poop ft. mayo
[21:42] <facetiousz> oh i can link one
[21:42] <facetiousz> hold on
[21:42] <starcaster603> I'm good! Just had dinner and finished downloading more music. Now I'm just playing Fallout 4 lol. How ya doing Mayo?
[21:43] <facetiousz> max https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBQ9Cc9EU2w
[21:44] <starcaster603> Uh let's see. I tried playing Fallout 4 vanilla and got through a good chunk of that till the frame rate did me in and couldn't finish my play through and have been playing it with mods ever since LUL I've been playing since Christmas of last year
[21:45] <starcaster603> And I play it on console for now. Xbox One base version till I can upgrade to a PC
[21:45] <starcaster603> Omg LUL
[21:46] <mintjoker505803> somebody give me an idea for a chat command
[21:47] <starcaster603> Yeah I'll try and help if I can. Haven't done a vanilla playthrough in a while but hopefully I can be of help ^.^
[21:48] <starcaster603> Especially if you're doing modded playthroughs. I can probably help with any issues with mods
[21:48] <facetiousz> one more while you eat lmao
[21:48] <facetiousz> yeah thats the one i was gonna link
[21:49] <starcaster603> Gotcha! Also, these Fallout poops are hilarious LUL
[21:49] <facetiousz> modded playthroughs are so good tbh @Starcaster603
[21:50] <starcaster603> ^ currently I'm making my game look like Metro with a greater emphasis on combat
[21:50] <facetiousz> i love the gameplay changing mods
[21:50] <facetiousz> ones that add bullet drop and what not
[21:51] <facetiousz> my survival mode was so hard even at level 50 that 4-6 shots could kill me
[21:51] <culturednoname> 1
[21:51] <mintjoker505803> hey @Mmmayo you got a link for merch? I can throw that on the bot
[21:51] <facetiousz> i didnt hear the options
[21:52] <culturednoname> 1=quests 2=build house more
[21:52] <facetiousz> go bang out some quests
[21:52] <starcaster603> O . O Jesus Facetious if you used faction overhaul mods you'd be insta killed probably
[21:52] <starcaster603> 1
[21:52] <facetiousz> i actually did lol
[21:52] <facetiousz> increased spawns and war of the commonwealth
[21:53] <culturednoname> brb
[21:53] <facetiousz> and gunner overhauls, where they were pretty much actually militants instead of baby raiders
[21:54] <starcaster603> @facetiousz I use The Deadly Commonwealth. Kinda does the same thing. Increased spawns and each faction is actually ya know, threatening
[21:54] <starcaster603> Oh and Arbitration
[21:54] <facetiousz> yess arbitration is a must
[21:55] <facetiousz> backseat gamer time
[21:55] <facetiousz> choose aquaboy @mmay
[21:55] <facetiousz> @Mmmayo
[21:56] <starcaster603> ^ am I allowed to suggest? I just don't want Mayo to waste perk points unless you got it covered @facetiousz
[21:56] <facetiousz> you can, he doesnt mind
[21:56] <facetiousz> we're preparing him for fallout 76
[21:56] <facetiousz> :)
[21:57] <facetiousz> find the water pump and follow it @Mmmayo
[21:57] <facetiousz> yes that one ffs follow it up the hill
[21:57] <facetiousz> nvm you did it so dw
[21:58] <starcaster603> Thanks! VANS is a no no because it's basically a compass when you activate Vats. I never actually used it because I'm usually looking at my map on the pipboy
[21:58] <facetiousz> basically just explore your little boobies off
[21:58] <starcaster603> Or ya know, there's already a quest marker active
[21:58] <facetiousz> truth ^
[21:59] <facetiousz> all of the baddass perks that were in new vegas, like shotgun surgeon (my favorite), was replaced by... vans...
[21:59] <mintjoker505803> change what settings?
[22:00] <mintjoker505803> I was trying to get it to auto clear anti-tos messages earlier but I'm having problems with slashes
[22:00] <facetiousz> also you can equip the dog chain on dogmeat @Mmmayo
[22:00] <mintjoker505803> maybe if you set the bot as a channel editor. but you could just set a mod as channel editor and have them do it
[22:00] <mintjoker505803> I can give it a shot later. I'm working on a poll function right now
[22:02] <starcaster603> They're actually made of rusted metal LUL but guns made of wood probably look just as terrible
[22:04] <facetiousz> you can find and buy hundereds of power armors
[22:04] <starcaster603> ^
[22:04] <starcaster603> Anything that is brought into town is unlimited. Like ammo if you can find it
[22:05] <starcaster603> The only things that aren't unlimited are the things you create in your settlements like houses furniture
[22:05] <facetiousz> he equipped jun long with a black suit and a minigun and shit himself when he figured out that was a thing @Starcaster603
[22:05] <justwillow_> yooo
[22:06] <justwillow_> criss ouais
[22:06] <mintjoker505803> hey willow
[22:06] <starcaster603> @facetiousz Jesus lol . Try coming back to town only to find it was blown up because you left a fat man lying around LUL
[22:06] <facetiousz> yeah @Mmmayo
[22:06] <starcaster603> And hey willow KonCha
[22:07] <facetiousz> or one of your settlers wont get out of your decked out power armor @Starcaster603 LUL
[22:08] <starcaster603> XD it did! I needed space and just left my fat man in the workshop and sometimes if your settlers aren't already armed, they'll take any weapons lying around if they're attacked by raiders
[22:08] <starcaster603> I remember using Piper as a companion and gave her X-01 Power armor. Painted it pink too! She enter got out of it
[22:08] <starcaster603> *never
[22:09] <facetiousz> i remember i armed piper with a wounding automatic radium rifle and everyyyyyyything died before i could do anything
[22:09] <starcaster603> Bleeding damage actually does something lol. She's crazy with automatic weapons
[22:10] <facetiousz> yeah bleed stacks unlike poison weapons
[22:10] <facetiousz> so imagine a wounding minigun, 25 damage continuously stacking
[22:10] <starcaster603> OP
[22:10] <starcaster603> I'd imagine that's very OP
[22:11] <facetiousz> and people thought an explosive minigun was op
[22:11] <starcaster603> IKR
[22:12] <facetiousz> oh btw @Mmmayo , put the difficulty on higher, maybe hard instead of very hard, so legendary enemies will spawn more often and you can get some bad ass items
[22:13] <facetiousz> your choice, enemies will just be harder to kill, but better stuff
[22:13] <facetiousz> will spawn from them*
[22:13] <facetiousz> the lines next to the dmng resist compare what you have on to whats selected
[22:13] <facetiousz> dmg***
[22:14] <facetiousz> look at the pluses and minuses next to the damage for weapons or the dmg resist on armors***
[22:15] <facetiousz> oh yeah one last thing @Starcaster603 , wounding combat shotgun, each pellet will stack as well, pretty damn op
[22:16] <mintjoker505803> !poll shout mayo show his tits?
[22:16] <mintjoker505803> should*
[22:16] <mintjoker505803> damn
[22:16] <starcaster603> Yep. Every pellet can be affected by elemental effects
[22:17] <mintjoker505803> it was kinda working before but now its broken again

[22:17] <mintjoker505803> I refreshed it
[22:18] <mintjoker505803> !poll are socks like gloves for your feet or are gloves like socks for your hands?
[22:18] <mintjoker505803> idk
[22:18] <mintjoker505803> serious question though
[22:18] <mintjoker505803> maybe mittens are like hand socks and toe socks are like foot gloves
[22:19] <facetiousz> nah save the rad-x for now
[22:19] <mintjoker505803> I think its just not responding at all
[22:19] <mintjoker505803> !gg
[22:19] <mintjoker505803> yeah its broken
[22:19] <facetiousz> also make sure one of those roaches wasnt legendary
[22:20] <mintjoker505803> !gg
01[22:20] <defenderbot_> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[22:20] <facetiousz> it'll be in the name "legendary radroach"
[22:20] <mintjoker505803> yeah the poll thing broke everything
[22:21] <starcaster603> After a legendary radroaxh spawned before I left Vault 111 I've hated em ever since LUL it killed me every time
[22:22] <starcaster603> True story! It spawned twice. Once when I first started. And another three days ago
[22:22] <souljax619> I'm the 25th viewer. What did I win? Kappa
[22:22] <facetiousz> with increased spawns i had a group of fully geared gunners spawn outside 111, i had to make a new character because there was no way around them LUL
[22:23] <souljax619> Woohoo
[22:23] <souljax619> mmmayo1 mmmayo1
[22:23] <hazypotter> @FacetiousZ unmute
[22:24] <facetiousz> i did lol
[22:24] <starcaster603> Good god lol. It's weird tho because my mods don't increase spawns outside of 111 or near sanctuary so I'm wondering if it's extremely rare to encounter legendary radroach before you head topside
[22:26] <starcaster603> If you're killing enemies without much trouble then I'd definitely take perks like Locksmith and Hacker
[22:28] <starcaster603> Diamond City is the best place to sell stuff. Any crap I don't need I usually sell if I'm not looking to scrap it
[22:29] <facetiousz> @Mmmayo check the minigun mods
[22:29] <facetiousz> and check how bad ass the shredder is
[22:30] <facetiousz> hahahahahahah
[22:30] <facetiousz> i had a mod that turned mine into the drill from bioshock
[22:31] <starcaster603> @facetiousz now that is badass
[22:32] <starcaster603> @facetiousz do use any custom weapon mods?
[22:35] <facetiousz> i use unique uniques
[22:35] <facetiousz> and more uniques
[22:37] <starcaster603> @mmmayo 7.5/10. Add a few things like tables and another couch and you've got yourself a pristine 10! And it's the post apocalypse. Not everything will look right in the post apocalypse lol
[22:40] <starcaster603> You're welcome TPFufun and you've got a 10

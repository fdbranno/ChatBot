/*
Simple "Now Playing" Script Designed for Twitch.TV Channels
Created by Blasman13 @ Twitch.TV/Blasman13

This simple script will post a message in your channel chat every time that a new song begins playing.
It does this by reading a text file of the current song being played from whatever software that you
are using (AnkhBot, Twobbler, etc.) and checks to see if it has changed since it has last checked it.

Use the commands "!nowplaying on" and "!nowplaying off" to enable and disable the script in your channel.

You will need to specify the exact location of the text file that is to be read from your computer.
For ease of use, uncomment (delete the ; character) from the appropriate line below. If you are *not*
using BlasBot.mrc, you will also have to change %mychan and $ModCheck in the script appropriately.
